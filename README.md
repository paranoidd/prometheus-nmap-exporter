# prometheus-nmap-exporter

This code is a kind of PoC regarding dead-simple external firewall monitoring.
For functional monitoring of TCP listeners, look at [prometheus/blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter)

This also served as Golang learning experience.

### TODO
- displayed metrics need descriptions, type definitions etc
- comments + docs
- tests
- automated build / pipeline using public CI systems
- docker hub(?)
